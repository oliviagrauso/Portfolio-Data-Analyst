## Be Data-Driven

These days, everyone talks about being *data-driven*. It means using data to answer real business questions.
Instead of guessing, we look at numbers and trends to understand things like:

- Which region is selling the most?
- What type of customer buys from us most often?
- Which marketing campaigns are bringing in the most new customers?
- Is there a version of our product that is not performing as expected?
- Are we delivering orders on time across all regions?

These answers come from data the business already produces, data that often isnâ€™t explored strategically.


As the funny quote says: **"In God we trust. All others must bring data."** 

This portfolio shows how I use Power BI to turn raw data into clear dashboards and visual reports that help businesses make smarter decisions.
